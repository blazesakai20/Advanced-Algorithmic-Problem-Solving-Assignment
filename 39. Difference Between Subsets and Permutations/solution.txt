.)Subsets
A subset is any selection of elements from a set, where order doesn't matter.
Can be of any size, including the empty set and the full set.
Each element can be included or excluded (2 choices per element).

Example:
Original set: {1, 2, 3}
All subsets:
[], [1], [2], [3], 
[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], 
[1, 2, 3]
Total subsets of a set with n elements: 2^n

.) Permutations
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of elements.
The position of elements matters.
Often used when arranging, sequencing, or shuffling items.

Example:
Original set: {1, 2, 3}
All permutations:
[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], 
[2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], 
[3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]
Total permutations of n elements: n!

Subsets:
Unordered
No duplicates
Example of [1, 2]: [], [1], [2], [1, 2]

Permutations:
Ordered arrangements
Example of [1, 2]: [1, 2], [2, 1]

Time Complexity:
Subsets: O(2‚Åø)
Permutations: O(n!)
