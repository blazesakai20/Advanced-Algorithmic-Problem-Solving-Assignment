What is a Priority Queue?
A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority, and the element with the highest 
priority is processed first, not necessarily the one that was added first.

Itâ€™s commonly implemented using a heap:
Min-heap: smallest value (highest priority) comes out first.
Max-heap: largest value comes out first.

ðŸ”¸ Key Operations
Insert: Add an element with its priority â†’ O(log n)
Pop: Remove the element with the highest priority â†’ O(log n)

ðŸ”¹ Applications in Algorithm Design
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm â€“ shortest path in graphs.
Huffman Coding â€“ builds optimal prefix codes using a min-heap.
Job Scheduling â€“ processes tasks based on urgency.
Top-K Problems â€“ find the largest/smallest K elements efficiently.
