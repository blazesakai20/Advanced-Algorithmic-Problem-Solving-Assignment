What is the Sliding Window Technique?
It involves maintaining a "window" (a subset) that slides over the input data. Instead of checking all possible subarrays or substrings (which can be inefficient), you move the window intelligently to reduce unnecessary computations.

There are two main types:

Fixed-size window: The window size is constant.

Variable-size window: The window size can expand and shrink based on conditions.

Example Use in String Problems

Find the longest substring without repeating characters
Brute force approach: Try all substrings – O(n²)

Sliding window approach:

Use two pointers (left and right) to define the window.

Expand the window by moving right.

If a duplicate is found, shrink the window from the left.

Keep track of the maximum length found.
